			<h4 class="baskervville-regular text-center">Why Permitting Solutions Matter</h4>
            <p class="text-center py-3">Whether you're planning new construction or renovations, navigating local permit requirements can be time-consuming and complex. With Whiddon Property Solutions, we ensure that all the necessary forms are properly handled, submitted, and approvedâ€”taking the guesswork out of permitting.</p>

            <p class="text-center py-3">An expired and active permit stays on the property records for years, and even when the property is sold to new owners, the issues are still linked to the property itself rather than to any specific owner.</p>

            <p class="text-center py-3">Permit violations can significantly hinder real estate transactions. If permit problems are overlooked during the sale, it can lead to serious consequences, as any unresolved violations will fall to the new owner(s).</p>
